# CMPE 172 - Lab #8 Notes


DESCRIPTION: 
- In this lab student will deploy Kong API Gateway and Starbucks API.. Student will create the network bridge to connect the application to Spring-starbucks-api via Kong. Kong will route the request to the API endpoint at starbucks-api. The deployment will be performed in both local environment for testing purpose and deployed on GKE for production. In order to test the connection endpoint, student will use Postman or CURL tool. 

CHALLENGES:
- Deprecated APIVERSION: when I created the ingress for KONG, I used the extensions/v1beta1 but I couldn't apply the configuration on GKE. After multiple efforts and research I figured out that the given version is deprecated and I need to update it using the networking.k8s.io/v1 instead extensions/v1beta1
- On GKE, at the beginning I assign the given IP address from CANVAS for the KONG on GKE but once I tried to test it then It didn't work because the KONG IP endpoint on my cluster is diffrerent. The resolution is to reassign with my KONG API. Finally It worked. 

DISCUSSION
- The changes would be needed in order to deploy your Starbucks API with MySQL / Cloud SQL: In order to connect to Cloud SQL on Google Cloud Service,I have to create Cloud SQL instance and set up start up quickstart-user. Set up the Cloud SQL Client role for Cloud SQL access. Then I will configure the secrets which is the credential for the Cloud SQL app. Update the deployment yaml file in Starbucks API with the connection endpoint and service for the GKE cloud SQL and upload to GKE cluster. At the final steps I will spin up the sql instance and deploy the deployment yaml file. After all done, using the External IP to access the application. 


1. Create docker network bridge for KONG API

3. Run KONG DBless mode and set the configuration for each service.. In this project, I will use unencrypted version so the Admin port is 8001 and the API port is 8444.
